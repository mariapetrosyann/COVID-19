# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction
This project involves scraping COVID-19 data from [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), followed by data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization. The dataset includes various columns such as Total Cases, New Cases, Total Deaths, New Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Critical Cases, and more. The goal is to gain insights into the COVID-19 pandemic through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn requests beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-19.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd COVID_19_CORONAVIRUS_PANDEMIC
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `COVID_19_CORONAVIRUS_PANDEMIC.ipynb` in your preferred environment.

## Running the Project

### Running Locally
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Open and run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code, scrape data, preprocess, clean, and visualize it.

## Libraries and Functions Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch data.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and scraping data from web pages.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, model evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing.

## Project Steps and Outputs

### Data Scraping
Scraped the COVID-19 data from [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) to gather up-to-date information on the pandemic.

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Performed data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values, correct data types, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

### Data Visualization
Used various visualization techniques to analyze and understand the data.

#### Correlation Matrix Heatmap
Generated a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features in the dataset.

#### Kernel Density Plot
Created kernel density plots to visualize the distribution of different features.

#### Scatter Plot
Created scatter plots to observe the relationships between different pairs of features.

## Results

### Example Visualizations

1. **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**
   - Shows the correlation between different features, helping identify strongly related variables.

2. **Kernel Density Plot**
   - Visualizes the distribution of features, indicating the density of data points across the range of values.

3. **Scatter Plot**
   - Illustrates relationships between pairs of features, highlighting potential trends and outliers.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates effective data scraping, preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization techniques applied to COVID-19 data. The visualizations provide valuable insights into the pandemic, helping to understand the relationships between different variables and the overall distribution of the data.
